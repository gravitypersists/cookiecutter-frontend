# Installation

You will first need `tmux` installed on your computer. `tmux` is a terminal multiplexer which we'll use to run TypeScript type checking and Parcel build compilation in multiple panes. You can install `tmux` with Homebrew if you prefer: `brew install tmux`.

Install the project:

`npm i`

Now run in development mode:

`npm run dev`
